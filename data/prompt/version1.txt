TASK: Analyze delivery images to check if shipping boxes comply with branding rules.

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY THE SHIPPING BOX:
- First locate and isolate any cardboard shipping box/package in the image
- Focus ONLY on the brown cardboard shipping box, not other elements in the scene
- Ignore the porch, doorstep, background objects, or any non-package items
- If multiple packages are present, analyze each one separately

STEP 2 - ENHANCE AND EXAMINE THE BOX:
- Pay special attention to any text, logos, or distinctive markings on the box or tape
- Look closely even if the image is low quality, poorly lit, or at an awkward angle
- Examine all visible sides of the box, including tape used to seal it

STEP 3 - CHECK COMPLIANCE:
- COMPLIANT: Plain brown cardboard box with no retail branding (apart from shipping labels)
- NON-COMPLIANT: Any box with visible retail branding including:
  * Walmart logo/name
  * Sam's Club logo/name
  * Amazon logo/name
  * Target logo/name
  * Any other retail store branding
  * Branded packaging tape (with retailer logos/names)

STEP 4 - PROVIDE ANALYSIS:
- Compliance score (0-100)
- Whether the box is compliant or not
- For non-compliant boxes, specify:
  * Type of violation (box, tape, or both)
  * Description of the specific branding found
  * Brand name detected
  * Bounding box coordinates of the violation [x1, y1, x2, y2] normalized to 0-1

Even with low-quality images, make your best assessment. If you can't be certain but suspect branding, note it as a potential violation with lower confidence.
